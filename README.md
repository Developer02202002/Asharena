A WIP 3d gladiatorial/sandbox/open-world rpg game example using the Ash framework ( http://github.com/nadako/Ash-HaXe ) and Ash3D boiler-plate( http://github.com/Glidias/ash3d ). 
	
	Basic core component/system game logic are all coded in Haxe (which can act as a base for other target platforms..). Take note that any engine-dependant implementations (rendering, particles, etc.) are coded in pure Flash/AS3, under Alternativa3D engine. 
	
Arena_HaxeSWC.hxproj - This is used to test-run the core component/system game logic for Flash under Haxe. 
src/compileswc.hxml  - Run this file to immediatley compile Haxe source code from anywhere into a SWC that can be used in  AS3 projects.
Arena_AS3.as3proj -  AS3 Project. This is for performing the final compile to deliver under Flash/ Alternativa3D.
