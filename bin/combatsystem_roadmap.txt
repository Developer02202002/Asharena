Rule mechanic roadmap:
______________________________

1) Interception fire + counter-attacking. (Like in Valkerie CHronicles)
Unlike Valkerie though, being triggered to be attacked by the target at melee range, while engaging the target, would yield different probablity hit/critical results, due to the fact that the enemy target might theoritically hit you in a certain manner first (or parrying), preventing you from hitting him. Unlike Valkerie Chronicles, perhaps this mechanic can be used to determine if a unit "retailiates" to begin with after being attacked) target within attack range once active aggroing target ends action turn, assuming the aggroing target is out of his we, assuming he already triggered an attack on you. Like in Valkerie Chronicles, no rolling for critical hits is done for such reaction attacks, which are all treated as "interception-fire". Some "aggressive-trait" enemies may have a slight move-engaging aggro to get into melee range prior to attacking you. Unlike Valkerie Chronicles, interception fire only occurs when you move (more rogue-like experience), this is because zooming in Valkerie Chronicles basically pauses time anyway so you can't move, so why should moving itself let time pass?  However, thrown projectiles will still continue to fly regardless of whether you're moving or not (see point no.4 regarding evading projectiles), so it's possible to dodge bullets still, assuming there's cover. (DONE. Interception fire portion for melee)

Retailatory attack mechanics: 
	-----------------------------

	
If you deem to strike triggered aggro first, aggro will revenge attack, regardless of whether you hit or miss (unless aggro gets killed with yr strike). You either pick evade or block in response to his revenge attack, depending on which is higher rating.
So, this attack runs as per normal as if you were defending. The difference is that you roll against his  evade/block/parry depending on the timing of the attack.

If triggered aggro deemed to strike you first, you either pick evade, block or parry against him, according to timing of his strike. 
Note that, aggro rolls against you first before you roll, including damage if he hits. If aggro's damage is deemed to kill you, you don't get to roll, and your attack is destined to miss and your turn is concluded with your death by his counter/revenge-strike (with your strike shown as "miss"). If aggro hits you first, you don't get to roll for criticals as well. So, your rolled crit percentage should be as per normal in this case (against defender) since the first aggro hit roll is already factored in.

(DONE)

(Advanced, choice between evade/block can depend on situation, if too close, cannot evade. If not within blocking range (too close/too far), etc.)

2) Smarter AI facing choice when turn ends for EnemyWath units: 
 
3) No 6th Sense: (Like in valkerie chronicles). Use of blind spots/FOV/LOS whree enemy isn't aware of activated unit at a particular time.

3a) Aggro can pre-trigger attack at start of turn even if player unit hasn't move yet.

(DONE!)
________________________

4) (Optional visibility) Enemy Arc markers (Like in varlkerie chronicles,..) to show enemy alertness to active moving player unit. Unlike Valkerie, the arcs are also  used to determine the arrow/thrown projectile paths, since they have to hom in on the player even if the player moves and tries to evade it, a rolled hit would mean the arrows/thrown projectiles is always destined to hit the player. Depending on the speed of the player with his evasion, or his blocking skill, the chances of being hit is determined accordingly. Using certain formations can provide bonuses against projectiles. It's possible for ranged projectile attacks to miss due to obstacles that get in the way of it's LOS, enroute to target, even if though the roll was a "hit", it can still result in an eventual miss due to projectile colliding against obstacles before hitting the player. THis is handled with the arc being frozen once it's interrupted by an obstacle along it's path (this technique is known as "breaking path").  Thus, it's still possible to dodge projectiles using obstacles (or crouching behind them). A rolled hit simply means "a shot on-target", so you can't evade it unless an obstacle gets in the way. It's possible for other static players to take damage instead of you as a result of this. Blocking a projetile with a shield will cause you some movement points. Perhaps, holding a shield up can use up movement points.

Integration of combat system with animations:
1) For melee inteception/retailiatory attacks, try the following approaches:
	
	REAL TIME REPRESENTATION: Attack swing animation is shown visually the moment an attack is triggered. This means the roll results are only determined upon impact of the swing animation.
	
	  - stop frame motion when moving about (with animation canceling when performing strikes simultaenous against each other during retaialotory attack cases..). The most true to life as far as time-detail is concerned, but the fact that you can see everything in slow paused motion, is a bit unrealistic. THis mode allows you to see all the anmimations in stop-motion, perhaps allowing a meta-game of trying to find "weak" moements during the enemy animation to deliver critical strikes/hits. But this may require a different/varying  set of rules that requires more "reactive" observation.
	  
	  	 - allow swinging animations to move forward in real-time instead. This turns this more into a "Reaction-game" which requires the player to go to target mode immediaely , or click attack fastest to try and counter the attack if he wishes. This approach rewards pressing the key as fast as possible though...which may go against the idea of what a turn-based game should be. 
	  
		DELAYED ATTACK REPRESENTATION: Attack swing animation is shown visually only when  rolled strike has occured on  player position. This means results are already determined before the attack swing animation occurs.
		
	  - freeze player movement when inteception strike has occured (particularly for strikes that are rolled as a hit, though this could be used for rolled misses as well). This hides the fact that an attack is about to happen, and it comes as a surprise ( a bit like X-com reaction fire cutscenes). This might be obstrusive because of the "cutscene" approach with freezing player movement in 3rd person view, though...Which is different from X-com, since X-com is a cutscene approach when moving men from place to place already. The advantage of this is that it's possible to orchestrate ducking/dodging animations in such sitations where miss has occured (assumign u wish to freeze motion  for misses as well, which can be obstrusive but quite cinematic). The problem is: IF misses and hit strikes occur often at a fast rate, this isn't good to animate constantly as it means a lot of game-breaking cutscenes.
	  
	 - (TEMPORARILY)
	  - consider playing the attacka animation at hyperspeed so it'll always "hit" if it needs to hit. This won't feel so realistic and might appear more abstract.
	  
	  (CHOSEN)
	  - create a bounding circle/oval arc around player when a rolled hit inteception strike has occured between attacker and player so that it's impossible for player to kite an animation attack that is destined to be a hit. A semi-transparent marked bounding circle arc above the ground can flash between the aggroed attacker and player, providing a "gamey" but suitable circular-blade-shaped indicator to represent the state of being moementarily trapped/hurt by a specific target due to a rolled hit. Some floating/descending numbers can be used to indicate damage taken, rather than reading the chat log. The circle blade circle indicator provides a bounding sector that "forces" the player to conform within bounds for a short moemnt without being too obstrusive. It has an advantage of clearly representing hit vs miss, events. Rolled miss animations can be angled/timed/interrupted in such a way to simulate misses, but may not be as foolproof compared to the earlier as you're still allowed to freely move around while a miss animation is in progress....Being hit while within the bounding circle can cause flinch animations to occur with the bounding circle acting as a slowdown, and the circle acts as a visual individator to say, "You're hit", you can't run yet until you've recovered. Perhaps, misses as a result of blocking/dodging can still be indicaeted within the circle (maybe a soft white circle around the unit that missed the strike instead of a hard red circle around player..), assuming an appropiate animation can be used in response to the missed strike (or perhaps, get the animated weapon arc direction to purposely miss based off the current player position, probably thrusting/swinign the weapon  at a high steep up angle, and and prevent the player  from momentarily entring the vinccity range based off the white circle where the weapon would hit him. If the player is already close, then it can be considered some sort of block where the weapon animation interrupts halfway, perhaps due to the player's body blocking the weapon motion, and maybe a word saying "Blocked/Missed" or something). Whatever it is, create soft circles that act as hit/miss useful situational awareness indicators for a turn-based game, without interrupting free-movement gameplay. This allows character to freely move about, yet avoid the strange situation where pre-rolled animation hits appear visually to have missed due to a character kiting the blow fast enough due to real-time movement, causing a swing in midair to "mysteirously" knock a player when it appears as a miss. Red/white circles also act as useful visual indicators for the number of specific hit/miss aggro events occuring between units (even when units are out of camera view, the number of red circles can be seen indiciating the number of hits you took in the process of running through enemy-filled locations), which works great for a strategy-type game even though the colors would give away whether the animated swings are registered as hits/misses, keeping track of results instantly is what's necessary, not suspense , particularly for interception fire.

	  In either actual/delayed time case, all incomplete aggro "swings" against the player are factored into the calculation where the player triggers an attack on his own as well on a particular target, affectng his chances of critically hitting the target assuming the enemy will strike and hit him first. Damage report of hits/misses occurs only when the animation is complete, even though the results are alraedy calculated beforehand.
	  
	  
	  
	2) FOr range attacks, just follow Valkerie style and a bit of 4), with the abilit to animation cancel if enemy changes his mind.

LOS Arc markers: (LOS arc markers can either vanish or freeze if  no more LOS found (and maybe change color), but still in aggro memory)
1) Level arc (for melee/gun-slingers) (bezier curve and straight-line stretch)
2) Arrow/Tracjectory of projectile Arc (for archers/spear thrwoers, etc..) , if still in aggro memory
APPROACH #1; Determine velocity with constant speed (LOB)
 -Divide straight line distance to target by SPEED, getting the number of intervals in between
  -Divide straight line displacement x/y/z by numIntervals to get velocity  without gravity taken into account
  -  Taking into acccount gravity, need to add more velocity.z altitude: vz += aboveValue*numIntervals*0.5;
 Total time = numIntervals;
 Divide total time to
 APPROACH #2: Determine speed given normalized velocity direction (do some algebraic shifting of above..)
  Can speed/power of shot be adjusted within range to match required direction?
 

Possible rule variations:
_________________________________________
* One rule variation is to only resolve non-sneak attacks  after round has completed (ie. a round where both sides have completed their phases), so everything is just targetted, but not attacked immediately unless attacking the enemy from behind. If using this approach, than one team serves, while the other responds (perhaps at half amount of movement points, since they have someowhat the "final" say) trying to aggro away targetted attacks.  Targetted attacks/auto-attacks are then resolved accordingly. This gives a "I go, You go" system of turns but attacks are only resolved once both sides have moved. The responding team cannot roll for critical attacks in this situation though. Once the responding team is done, they get to serve the new round by starting first. This avoids the silliness of inactive units just sitting back (unable to respond) as someone else on their team gets hit by an enemy.

* Each unit can only move once and attack once. No re-using/spamming command points on same unit. Thus, there's no actual command point usage.

 * Link attacks? (like in Shining Ark)
