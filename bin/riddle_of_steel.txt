Attempt exit - 
Use all CP on Full Evade
Use all CP thrust on above

Pre-phase:
Prepare any available stances for next phase begin

Begin phase!


Attempt exchange:
Roll decided Attack/Defense for your exchange
If you have initiative, ?Target can respond on the spot according to your chosen Attack if target has AI?, else if target has initiative and available AI to attack, you get to respond.  

Interception attack exchange: 
Roll Defense Response required if target has initiative, AI for available attack action.

Opputunity Attack:
Force Auto Roll Defense (Full Evade all CP) vs Force Auto Roll Attack (Thrust all CP). 


AI Framework:
--------------------------

Against AI, the AI targets always have available attack/defend action during any type of exchange. This streamlines the situation of having a particular player on a certain turn, dealing/receiving an exchange from their given targets by having those actiosn resolve immediately, rather than having to wait for an opposing player response for every melee exchange of blows.

Otherwise, receiving an Interception attack exchange will result in a pinned character and attempting an Exchange on a target will result in pinning the character in position as well. Then, having to wait for the responses on the enemy's turn. This slows the agme down to the crawl down to individual blows between enemies. Thus, an AI framework is used to help train your units to automate various special manuevers given specific situations.

AI programs for:
- Defending against known attacks  respectively for exchange 1 and 2...
- Attacking against unknown defense  respectively for exchange 1 and 2...
- Attacking against known attacks  for exchange 1 only (ie. he has intiaitive)
- Attacking against unknown attack  for exchange 1 only (ie. you have initiative)
A total of 6 combination AI programs


Input parameters:
----------------------
Knowing the Situation:
Exchange (This/Last)
 - his/mine CP being spent in last exchange (if known)
 - his/mine current manuever in exchange (if  known)
    - his/mine target area in exchange (if  known)
(excluding mine for this.exchange)

If input reference implications/restrictions:
---------------------------------------------
lastExchange => Exchange 2 
thisExchange.his => Defending or attacking against known attack


Output parameters:
---------
*My Manuever to use
*My Amount of CP to use


Knowing the Enemy:
- His known total CP stat
- his health-related CP lost for this exchange() // either due to shock (or pain if exchange 1)
- his StanceBonusOrPenaltyForThisExchange

- his available CP left to spent for this exchange():  His known total CP stat - Health Related lost for this exchange - (lastExchange ? lastExchange.his : 0) + StanceBonusOrPenaltyForThisExchange


Knowing Myself:   
- My total CP stat
- My health-related CP lost for this exchange() // either due to shock (or pain if exchange 1)
- mine StanceBonusOrPenaltyForThisExchange

- mine available CP left to spent for this exchange():  Mine known total CP stat - Health Related lost for this exchange - (lastExchange ? lastExchange.his : 0) + StanceBonusOrPenaltyForThisExchange
