Ashes of the Arena:  
********************** 
The World Situation:
A mysterious haze (collectively known as The Ash) has taken over the entire world, changing it's landscape entirely, and leaving few survivors to fend for themselves against strange creatures emerging from the ashey depths itself. It's up to our brave warriors to restore back the land which was one's theirs, by expanding outwards, and conquering lands, clearing away the mist. However, it seems that the land which they once knew has changed drastically as a result of uncovering the mist,  mostly now flooded with water and consisting mostly of islands. Also, the entire world seems to be no longer a finite planet that runs in full circle, but seems to go on forever. Perhaps, the world has expanded. Will humanity be able to find back the land which was originally theirs, or create a new one in this new era? Or will the Ash finally engulf the whole planet and destroy it completely for the humans?

3 Vikings & Me  (Singleplayer replayable)
------------------------------
At Infinitus Carribean : A Prequel

Introducing our 3 Viking Warriors:
- Eldgrim Smidkelson  (Berserker)
- Astrador Finnrson   (Spearman)
- Strolf Hallgeirson  (Axeman)

And the Main Protagonist:
- (Your own Name here) (Swashbuckler/Marksman from the Pirate Confedaracy)	
	
You can play all 4 characters though, but the Main Protagonist MUST survive. This is like a singleplayer tutorial/gameplay/tech demo showing everything from ship exploration/combat, and visiting islands  for land-based exploration/combat. It is replayable because your starting location can begin anywhere in the world, and the event seed can be changed, varying the environment/experience accordingly.


The Actual Game (Multiplayer persistant)
