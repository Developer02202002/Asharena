Ashes of the Arena:  
********************** 
The World Situation:
A mysterious haze (collectively known as The Ash) has taken over the entire world, changing it's landscape entirely, and leaving few survivors to fend for themselves against strange creatures emerging from the ashey depths itself. It's up to our brave warriors to restore back the land which was one's theirs, by expanding outwards to conquer the surrounding lands, clearing away the mist. However, it seems that the land which they once knew has changed drastically as a result of uncovering the mist,  mostly now flooded with water and consisting mostly of islands. Also, the entire world seems to be no longer a finite planet that runs in full circle, but seems to go on forever. Perhaps, the world has expanded. Will humanity be able to find back the land which was originally theirs, or create a new one in this new era? Or will the Ash finally engulf the whole planet and destroy it completely for the humans?

3 Vikings & Me  (Singleplayer replayable)
------------------------------
At Infinitus Carribean : A Prequel

Introducing our 3 Viking Warriors (aka. your VIking misfits):
- Strolf Hallgeirson  (Axeman)
- Astrador Finnrson   (Spearman)
- Eldgrim Smidkelson  (Berserker)

And the Main Protagonist:
- (Your own Name here) (Swashbuckler/Marksman from the Pirate Confedaracy)	
	
You can play all 4 characters though, but the Main Protagonist MUST survive. This is like a singleplayer tutorial/gameplay/tech demo showing everything from ship exploration/combat, and visiting islands  for land-based exploration/combat. It is replayable because your starting location can begin anywhere in the world, and the event seed can be changed, varying the environment/experience accordingly. You can travel about raiding islands and various places on your Viking boat.


The Actual Game (Multiplayer persistant)
-------------------------------------------

Currently there are 2 known surviving warrior inhabitant groups, that originally came from opposite ends of the world map before the Ash took over, and their original lands....lost and missing. These 2 known surviving inhabitant groups provide a two different RPG styles to the player, one more tailored to open-ended "classless" Elder Scrolls type of characters, while the other veers more towards poster Diablo-esque characters with classes and fixed skillsets.

_________


Dominul Inhabitants' Races:  (see story.txt for more information on Dominul races and their origins. Currently loosely based off Gladiator Half-life Mod)
	- Slavus 
	- Dimochi
	- Samnians
	- Flammites

Choice of a race can tend to favor certain skills and attributes a bit more than others, but players are still be able to train all other skills without being limited to a character class, allowing more flexibility character development. However, they start out with generally less equipment and resources.
	
	
Before The Ash:
The Realm of Dominul was originally an empire under Imperial rule in the Continent of Asharena until state gladiators started a rebellion which overthrew their masters, forming a new republic that unfortunately did not work out and wasn't entirely peaceful in the end.

_________

Euridin Inhabitants' Factions and classes (currently based off Pirates, Knights and Vikings 1 Half-life mod):
	
- Pirate Confederacy (Skirmisher, Sniper, Pirate Captain)
- Viking Seafarers   (Axeman, Spearman, Berserker)
- Knights' Order     (Heavy Knight, Man-At-Arms, Bowman)

Every faction allows sub-choices of 3 character class unique to each faction. They provide much more starting powerful and specialized (sometimes even exclusive, but fixed) skills with proper equipment at the beginning of the game, and they improve as the character progresses. 

Before The Ash:
	Euridin was a region consisting of simple townsfolk wanting a good life, caught among 3 powerful warring factions of entirely different idealogies.

BOAT crew party management:
-------------------
Players form up a boat party under the following constraints:

Personal/Storage capacity: 18 points
Command(power) point capacity: 20 points

Alpha - 10 command points per person. Such a person can command up to 10 men of varying classes. Alphas dominate/coerce Betas into doing their will due to their standing/position. Alphas don't get along well with other Alphas due to their strong personalities, regardless of similar ideals. The only thing they might share in common is their shared interest in dominating Betas. They appear in the smallest of numbers.

Beta - 1 command point per person. Such a person Can only command up to 18 men of the same class so long as no alphas/omegas are around due to good rapport/similarity among themselves. They are basically the masses. They look similar to other regular crowd-based NPCs.

Omega - 5 command points per person. Such a person can command up to 6 men of varying classes. Omegas are amiable, charismatic, and lead and convince betas through rhetoric and ideas. Omegas tend to submit to Alphas, but can often not get along well with other Omegas of differing ideas. They appear in small to medium numbers.

Zeta - 3 command points person. Such a person doesn't command anyone and is more of an anti-social lonewolf. They can work under Alphas/Omegas under certain circumstances. Zeta tends to be a "special" type of character class social category and can appear in either large or small numbers. 


Possible combinations and their outcomes (excluding the inclusion of Zetas):

2 alphas - 2 personal occupied. 16 free storage space on boat. 
RESULT: This is unsustainable. 2 bored alphas on the boat with plenty to eat until supplies run out, but have nothing else better to do but banter every second, lacking any real manpower.

3 omegas, 3 betas - 6 personal occupied. 12 free storage on boat.  Fully uses command points.
RESULT: Rather unsustainable.  3 omegas will have too much differing ideas and conflict in opinion, and overall not much manpower.

---------------------

18 betas -18 personal occupied. 0 free storage space on boat.  Fully uses command points.
RESULT: Great for raw manpower/labor/rioting parties. But no further storage on boat possible unless lesser Betas are used. 

1 omega, 6 betas - 7 personal occupied. 11 free storage space on boat.
RESULT: If more betas are used (up to 17), they tend can't be managed well and would be outside Omega's control/influence. 

2 omegas, 10 betas - 12 personal occupied. 6 free storage on boat.  Fully uses command points.
RESULT: Less betas can be used to make up for avaialble storage. 2 omegas may have differing ideas and can conflict in opinion.

1 alpha, 10 betas - 11 personal occupied. 7 storage space on boat. Fully uses command points.
RESULT: Autocratic command and control. Betas can be freed to make up for storage space on boat.

1 alpha, 1 omega, 5 betas - 7 personal occupied. 11 free storage space on boat. Fully uses command points.
RESULT: Betas can be freed to make up for storage space on boat.

Results are aggreated in terms of, and can be reoredered according to one's intended criteria:
	1) Manpower command capability  - How much manpower is available on boat.
	2) Free storage capacity - How much free storage space on boat.
	3) Command effeciency - How effective the command is
	4) Manpower satisfaction - How satisfied/happy is manpower with command.
	5) Variety - How varied the skillset of the party is
	
	
FACTION POWER CONTROL/ BALANCE OF POWER:
-------------------------
Within a party, there can be intrigue depending on the mix of different factions. Each faction specialises in certain type of combat, thus the advantage of having multiple factions in a party is a good way to achieve a common objective, at the cost of potential conflict and sub-plots within the party itself.  People from certain factions tend not to cooperate with people from other factions due to history. Thus in such sitautions, NPCs can either become willing servants  or unwilling slaves within the manpower dynamic (were they captured or hired?). Percentages reflect the range of animosity that can occur between the different factions (from 0% to MAX%). THis is a random factor that can affect the cohesiveness of an NPC party, or the kind of power dynamics that occur. (eg. are the betas captured slaves or willing workers?). For hybrid faction classes, the average floored mean is used, or if a faction match occurs, than the animosity is considered fully to the other faction (a disadvantage of hybrid races) between follower to leader, but zero animisoity is considered between leader to follower.

Pirates: Dislikes both vikings and crusaders equally (45%/45%), than gladiators (10%).
Crusaders: Dislikes vikings first (40%), than pirates and gladiators equally. (30%/30%).
Vikings: Dislikes crusaders first (50%), then pirates (30%), than gladiators (20%).
Gladiators: Dislikes crusaders first (50%), then pirates (30%), than vikings (20%).

Anytime the random result (Math.random()*percentage) exceeds 25%, animisoity is considered accordingly against that faction in such a way that would affect the metagame to a certain degree, and would affect effectiveness of command or make commanding not possible at all. Anything 25% or below would simply appear in dialogue as "tongue-in-cheek" speech, but have no bearing in the game. If the amount of average animisoity between 2 levels meets or exceeds 50% or above (ie. 50-25=25%), than command is no longer possible and the status is automatically set to hostile/mutiny cases.  Animisoity is multiplied against the total sum of command (power) points between the different factions. Thus, a huge amount  of betas can have as much power (if not more) than a single alpha, thus making command not possible. Thus, since percentage total animisotiry for all betas cannot exceed the 25% threshold for each laeder, this also adds a limit to how many people you can command at once, and also the nature of the relationship. You can have more than 1 leader though, meaning 2 leaders provide 50% threshold, 3 leaders provide 75% threshold. This however, doesn't really reduce the base animisotity per beta, it just overpowers the othe rside in terms of numbers, making it hard for betas to go against the alpha/omega's wishes.

Eg. scenerio test
	A single Viking-Pirate hybrid (alpha/omega) tries to command up to 8 betas.
	   - 8 gladiators (	25%-25=0% animisority towards leader ) ( 15%-25=0% animosity towards servants) 0% animosity averaged per beta. 
	   - 8 vikings ( 30%-25=5% animisority towards leader ) ( 0% animisoity towards servants ) 2% animisity averaged per beta.
	   - 8 pirate   ( 45%-25=20% animisority towards leader ) ( 0% animisoity towards servants ) 10% animisity averaged per beta.
	   - 8 crusaders ( 35%-25=10% animisority towards leader ) ( 47%-25=22% animisoity towards servants ) 16% animisity averaged per beta.
	   
	A single Viking (alpha/omega) tries to command up to 8 betas.
	  - 8 gladiators ( 25%-25=0% animisority towards leader ) ( 32%-25=7% animosity towards servants) 3% animosity averaged  per beta. 
	  - 8 pirate   ( 45%-25=20% animisority towards leader ) ( 0% animisoity towards servants ) 10% animisity averaged  per beta. 
	  - 8 crusaders ( 40%-25=15% animisority towards leader. ) ( 25% animisoity towards servants. ) 20% animisity averaged per beta.  
	   
	A single Gladiator (alpha/omega) tries to command up to 8 betas.
	  - 8 vikings  ( 20%-25=0% animisority towards leader ) ( 20%-25=0% animosity towards servants  ) 0% animisity averaged  per beta.  
	  - 8 pirate   ( 10%-25=0% animisority towards leader ) ( 30%-25=5% animisoity towards servants ) 2% animisity averaged  per beta. 
	  - 8 crusaders ( 30%-25=5% animisority towards leader. ) ( 50%-25=25% animisoity towards servants.  ) 15% animisity averaged per beta.  
	  
	A single Crusader (alpha/omega) tries to command up to 8 betas.
	  - 8 vikings  (50%-25=25% animisority towards leader ) ( 40%-25=15% animosity towards servants  ) 20% animisity averaged per beta. 
	  - 8 pirate   (45%-25=20% animisority towards leader ) ( 30%-25=5% animisoity towards servants ) 12% animisity averaged per beta
