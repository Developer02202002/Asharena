1. AttackAnimSystem 

Realistic action settings:...
(KIV) Blocking it with shield while in crouched/cautious/combat-idle stance (or having it be blocked by a KIV obstacle) may result in a min time penalty  being incurred based off the time you didn't move while the projectile is travelling from the time it was launched. 

Evasion should shuold be considered against moving velocity target (sideway shot displacement) at the time the weapon was launched.
(KIV consider experiement) This could be factored into spending enough movement time units moving against the weapon time direction perpendically, allowing the fire to be converted to a miss.....

2. (KIV for 1. comment for Reflex Urgency mode) Zooming in to target mode can get moving projectiles to pause based off capped time units grid. Projectiles will only travel further for remaining time it takes to raise ranged weapon up for aiming against time unit grid. This allows player to launch projectile or slash before being hit by others' reaction fire. Note that using this mode means you will lose time in real-time so long as there are enemy moving projectiles. However, you are able to block projectiles in this mode without lost of TUs as well. So, the only disadvantage is that real-time always passes whenever there are enemy reaction projectiles/swings occuring.

(Far-sighted reaction) (Default)

Ranged vs melee:
Ranged units are engaged only when THEY are within range of another enemy melee's weapon range.
This effectively locks them down and they cannot turn to shoot someone else.

Ranged vs Ranged:
Ranged units are engaged only when THEY are within range of another ranged enemy melee's weapon range.
This effectively locks them down and they cannot turn to shoot someone else.

OR

(Near-sighted reaction)
Ranged units are only engaged against the closest target within a certain kind of pseudo-melee aggro range. 
They will automatically turn to face active moving unit in that range.

OR 

Random sighted reaction...


For Melee: How to lock down a melee character......
---------------------------------------------------

(Far-sighted reaction) (Default)
Melee vs Melee:
Melee units are engaged only by other enemy melees within their weapon ranges or can engage another melee by their own weapon range.

Melee vs Ranged:
Melee units are engaged only by another ranged by their own weapon range or another ranged enemy's melee weapon range.

OR

(Near-sighted reaction)
Melee units are only engaged against the closest target within their aggro range (or a certain kind of aggro range).

OR 

Random sighted reaction...



Melee units will still turn to face any active moving units within their aggro range regardless and cannot be locked down by passive units.

End turn reaction facing: *
Disable turning   / Enable turning /  Random Turning(unless within engagement range), Absolutely Random Turning




Aesthetics:
---------------

1. Add rocks /obstacles/trees/jetty bounds/ship etc.  *
2. Splat terrain   (required) *

(KIV)
