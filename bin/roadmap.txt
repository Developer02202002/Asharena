Old roadmap:

1) Test load all chars for current island (single-island.swf)
2) Docked Viking Ship and collision model on island
3) Place Biomes, terrain, props, etc.  as part of above process with location specific collisions


3 Vikings & Me:  (three-vikings-and-me.swf)
------------------
4) Rocking Ship and collision and piloting mode /  Sea Obstacles & encounters
5) Intro and ship exploration
6) (all chars with animations + punching + weaponary)
7) Monsters and AI 


Asharena: (ash-arena.swf)
---------------------
- Multiplayer integration
- Character stats and actual rules for different character types.

Saboteur Arena: (saboteur-arena.swf)
------------------------
- Minigame (River map)
- Multiplayer integration.

______________________________________________

1) Include tumble-left/tumble-right, (jump velocity, ground normal WILL always not be available, or at least something to disable surface movmeent during duration of tumble) ! *
1a) (find a way to also include... longjump ability...) !

Animation fixes to:
- fix jump hangups *
- standing mode should use manual skin rotation and jog towards diection for strafe movement
- changing direction (strafe left - middle - strafe right ) should include animation blending  and gradual acceleration to either direction. (lower body dominant strafe vs upper body dominant strafe)
- changing stance could  take time and temporarily prevent any movement (velocity always set to zero!).  
  ->  default combat animation should be assigned to full-body  to support seamless transitioning of stance from combat to standing.
   -> full-body standing should be assigned to the 2 half-controllers. (instant pose) to lower stance to combat.
   //-> find a way to resolve combat->crouch stances and vice versa, 
 - possible to include falling jump animation

1b) Melee Attack.  Attach weapon to hand! * 
1c)  Spell: projectile/target/area-effect based attacks. First person view for projectile/target based attacks. Some projectiles are bouncing type, and some are sticky.... *
2) Paged terrain loading methods... * 
3) Actual gameplay demo  with some simple monsters, and reminaining 3 gladiators to choose from *



// -----------------------------------

Atheletics: (Considerations)
----------
1) The ability to immediately sprint from a crouching/combat position without having to change stance. (Acceleration pickup varies depending on skill).
2) Crouch + Sprint + Attack combo. (Pouncing attack)


Acrobatics: (Considerations)
----------
1) Variable Jump Power (Falling animation frame), 
2) Scale walls/Vault obstacles with jump and no jump. (Auto-jump when sprinting ahead)
3) Tumble when fall from great height (hold sprinting while in air?)

NEW ROADMAP:

For each island:

1) Towns/Villages: - Random Dungeon Layout over flattish areas ( processing async and save )
2) Resources & doodads: - Cave (marching squares in subtract), Noise over biome regions. Sparse noise doodads for stuff outside resource regions. (sync processing)
3) Rock outcrops along steep slopes: (especially at coast) (sync processing)
4) Dock jetty: - Bridge building minigame: (Saboteur style) or some random maze algorithm form start/end

(sync processing)
- Low/High resolution 512x512/1024x1024 splat/height (restricted to 3 textures and 1 slope texture)
- 512x512 blit maps that will stretch accordingly for larger environments.


Build dock scenerio
---------------------
Pathfinders have already went ahead and have called to build a dock location at a newfound island. Your boat party is requested to join in and supervise the construction of the dock.


Acid/oil water dock jetty disembark scenerio
---------------------------------------------
Either: 
1) Island area coasts are all cliffed up......, meaning only accessible from dock
2) Waters surrounding island is acidic, preventing boat from moving further in, having to disembark from outer.
3) A thick fog has descended on the island, preventing boat from safely travel further in.
4) Lots of rock outcrops around the coast, requiring diembarkabation at dock.

Boat party lands at dock,  while towns/villages will get generated in the background...After clearing the area of fog from within the loci of the dock, fog clears and entire terrain (is fully) revealed with towns also visible. Towns do not exist outside the vincity of the fog, but fog will be extremely thick. Enemies are in your way! Taking into account collision detection, move your blob party (or multiple parties) along the dangerous jetty and combat monsters accordingly.



Tech Roadmap: 
a) PRE-GENERATE: Plant resource areas/doodads on island
b) PRE/MAN-GENERATE: Jetty Dock location and structure on specific side of island 
c) POST-GENERATE: This can be done in prologue jetty crawling, or done progressively on-demand
	1) Identify flat areas to place village block layout
	2) Connect villages together
	3) Consider series of flat areas and whether to enclose them as walled city.
	
Open-world turn-based abstract blob combat system. (Move by meter, draw path, click on destination auto-generate path, etc.)
d) Initial: Abstract first person blob, and non-movable 3rd person preview and position markers.
e) Try: Blobs with individual break-out/follow approach.
