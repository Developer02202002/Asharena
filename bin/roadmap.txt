Certain parts of these mechanics can also be adapted to real-time action RPGs as well.

Basic enemy LOS aggro watch/defense system
------------------------------------------
All surrounding enemies that aren't engaged, will watch activated unit forever so long as the activated unit is within their 2D FOV facing and isn't occluded. For enemies that have 2D FOV facing on activated unit, but have another target within engagement range to focus on, they'll only focus on the unit conditionally if they get closer than the current nearest enagement range. For enemies that aren't engaged, they are kept in a dormant list to be checked for unoccluded 2D FOv Facing falling into view.

For enemies that are already watching you, they'll always turn to look at you once you get into engagement range against them.

Enemies that specifically watch you will always turn to look at you regardless of range.

Turning speed happens according to time being passed as the player moves.


An alerted enemy can always attack you so long as you are within range of them and you are within the weapon cone. They will always go to combat mode instantly once you get within engagement range aginst them.

An attack cooldown is provided for the enemy in their attempt to try and attack you (though in most situations, they can only deliver 1-3 hits at the most within the time of the turn). This means they can deliver more hits overall, but no chance of critical hit for them unless you aren't in combat mode (or your back/side is exposed while moving). AN implicit time passed is also used per attack intiated by the player, allowing the enemy to counterattack in response as well if the attack cooldown is availble for him.

A triggered silent attack on the enemy will occur so long as you are within range, but it will take some time to pass for the strike to unfold. During the unfolding process,there is an animation canceling timeframe threshold where the attack is considered to not have happened(ie. no cooldown used, often occurs with the raising of the weapon but not yet swinging it yet) , and a strike time (ie.variable weapon swing time before impact depending on range) before hit is calculated. If the player is out of range and angle when the strike time has occured, the strike is considered a miss automatically. If the player is out of range before the execution of the weapon's swing where the cooldown is triggered, the attack is canceled. Whether the attack animation plays or not (as a forewarning to allow kiting, lucid parrying), or a message being used, is up to the game's design (or otherwise, a cutscene is used to represent a reaction strike hit when it occurs...). A random "mood" threshold is provided for the enemy that determines a minimum range he wishes to trigger the attack, depending on the type of "hit" he is going after. More experienced enemies will take the player's velocity into account in determining whether to go ahead with the strike, or cancel it.

% Chance to Hit, % Chance to Critical (x3 damage), n hits/n criticals to kill, Damage ranges
-----------------------------------------------------
Base damage range for hit
x3 for Critical hit

A random base damage value is selected from the range. This is used for rough n prediction only.
- approximate damange inflicted with damageReducedDue to overall armor at facing.


% Chance to hit based off enemy facing 

% Chance to critical based on facing of enemy and range (<= 75%-n% within threshold), which uses the weapon's critical range against critical unarmored exposure at facing.

% Chance to stun based on facing of enemy (will he be taken by surprise?) and type of weapon (it's stopping power) against parts of the body. A stun will basically cancel the attack and create a forced cooldown weapon for the enemy, so he can't trigger an attack until his weapon cooldown is finished in realtime situations. He also cannot move about within the turn or within melee reaction attacking range. Thus, a stunned enemy can NEVER counterattack or move throughout the entire turn. A stunned player would mean all his movement points are shut down to zero (or near-zero) to represent staggering movement.



1) Roll for hit first 
2) If hit and still alive, roll for critical (or if no longer alive, can still roll for the sake of determining "overkill" fatalities)
3) If hit critical and still alive, roll for stun


Resolving triggered simulatenous attacks between enemy and player:
--------------------------------------------------------
In the event the player strikes, but the enemy side has also triggered an attack but hasn't reached cooldown  yet, the enemy will attempt to parry/block/evade depending on how close they are towards their threshold  of their usage of cooldown. The nature of the weapon and equipment will than determine how well they go about in parrying/blocking, if he happens to be not be able to evade in such a situation. If both sides have used the cooldown already, than the one that has the faster due strike time will attempt to hit first. In either case, the slower unit will attempts respond-attack by his strike (assuming he isn't already dead/stunned). If you do get hit in your attempt to respond-attack, you have no chance to critical strike, though. Thus, the displayed predicted percentage change to critical strike in such a case would be the percentage chance an enemy (being faster) might miss, multiplied by the base critical hit percentage. Also, if the enemy is bound to hit you before you hit him, the displayed % Chance to hit in such a situation is a multiplication using the base % hit chance multiplied by percentage chance to NOT get killed/stunned by the enemy beforehand (ie. baseHitPerc * %Chance to survive any normal hit||1 * %Chance to not get stunned). This percentage chances are aggregated and displayed, to determine a rough result on whether the player would have succeeded in hitting the enemy, and if not, whether he survived as a result of it. Thus, a simple animation result can be displayed in "fixed" order, where  the player always strikes first, while the enemy always "responds". However, in reality, it could be the enemy actually did attack first...Just that for the sake of consistency, the animation shows the player misses first, than the enemy counters and either stuns/kills the player, which could be a reason why why the player actually "missed" earlier. Or both sides could exchange blows. Or both sides miss blows. Whichever order you use, (ie. enemy stuns/kills the player first, player can't respond thus "misses"), the end result is still the same since it's all aggreagated to determine the final destiny. This implicitly means a player with lower health can also tend to have a lower %chance to hit, due to the fact that a faster counter-attacking enemy (often with good damaging weapons) has a higher % change to deal a killing blow on you already. 


Resolving attacks between enemies with different weapon ranges:
	If the player has a longer range weapon compared to an enemy, does it mean the enemy can never respond? THere should still be a threshold where the enemy could walk a step or 2 in order to deliver a responding attack. However, in order to get a critical hit, the maximum range of the weapon isn't too effective and would require moving some closer. So, perhaps, it's fine, considering that only 1 attack can be done. But the problem with CPs, it can be spammed!
_________________

ORGANISED FORCES:
All organised forces can travel across the sea by boat (with the exception of flying creatures/giants) and attack islands, making them possible aggressors in a given scenerio, instaed of just defenders. They have their own language, and knowing their language (or finding one that can interprate) is required for diplomacy.


Non-Human forces:
---------------------------
War Trolls
The Armored Ones	(some may travel by air)
Shadowmen 		(travels by large Shadowman Overlord instead of by Boat)
Elementals 		(travels by Air instead of by Boat)
Ghost Rogues
Goblin-orcs
Goblin-halflings
Minotaurs

Human Factions 
----------------
Gladiators
Vikings
Crusaders
Pirates

All factions can co-exist under the Union. They all spaek the English language.

All organised forces are divided into group/game designations of:
Delta, Iota, Phi, Chi


AMPHIBIOUS/AIRDROP MISSIONS: (Free roaming)

Invasion:
----------
For Defenders:  Organised Forces are willing to invade the island and encroach inland against known opposition which may be another organised force, or a native group, using plenty of resources/equipment/boats to do so.  One must decide if holding the dock (if available)/coast is necessary or not. An island can be invaded from multiple sides, thus you might need to move inland to defend to avoid being spreaded too thin at the coast. In the case of invasion, the defenders are usually outnumbered, which requires the use of static defenses and positions to gain an advantage over the attackers.
For Attackers: Play the attacking side in an attempt to lay siege on an island!

Raid:
------
For Defenders: An island can be raided from a particular side discreetly. There are designated patrolling circle routes on the island itself that can be followed along where storage/industrial buildings exist. Other areas to defend include dock paths leading to oil wells and mining shafts. Determine which side possible raiders could be invading from. Raiders can come in the form of flying enemies, and may not necessarily be organised forces but simply scavengers. Your objective is to protect any inland storages, mining shafts and dock (if available).
For Attackers: Perform a raid on an island.  Cannons and gunpowder are are best used to take. But resources and other stuff are worth trying to get. In some cases, disrupting/causing damage to their infrastructure is also a good tactic.

Colonization:
---------------
As a pathfinder, your job is to attempt to explore a given island in an attempt to take it. However, an island might be contested by other organised forces coming in from other areas, or/and include indigenous population or just creeps/monsters. Your job is to "secure" the island as an advanced party (clearing away monsters/creeps and such), and send in a signal for builders to come, once done. In some cases, the player can open-endedly choose not to colonize an island but let the island remain "free", if already owned by another indigenous population with whom you can communicate/negotiate with. If there are rival forces trying to take an island, one could negotiate a shared plan for a given island instaed of fighting over it.

In a typical amphibious (beach landing)/air-drop island scenerio, there are actually only 2 basic cases. Either one side attacks and the other defends on a large/small scale. Or, both sides try to attack an island that is currently "no-man's/some other creature's" land.


SABOTEUR PATH BUILDING MISSIONS: (RTC tile-based movement)
- Build jetty at assigned location to given destination (either inland or towards an oil well or towards a mining shaft)
- Clear mining tunnels to lead to Gold

	
______________________________________________

1) Include tumble-left/tumble-right, (jump velocity, ground normal WILL always not be available, or at least something to disable surface movmeent during duration of tumble) ! *
1a) (find a way to also include... longjump ability...) !

Animation fixes to:
- fix jump hangups *
- standing mode should use manual skin rotation and jog towards diection for strafe movement
- changing direction (strafe left - middle - strafe right ) should include animation blending  and gradual acceleration to either direction. (lower body dominant strafe vs upper body dominant strafe)
- changing stance could  take time and temporarily prevent any movement (velocity always set to zero!).  
  ->  default combat animation should be assigned to full-body  to support seamless transitioning of stance from combat to standing.
   -> full-body standing should be assigned to the 2 half-controllers. (instant pose) to lower stance to combat.
   //-> find a way to resolve combat->crouch stances and vice versa, 
 - possible to include falling jump animation

1b) Melee Attack.  Attach weapon to hand! * 
1c)  Spell: projectile/target/area-effect based attacks. First person view for projectile/target based attacks. Some projectiles are bouncing type, and some are sticky.... *
2) Paged terrain loading methods... * 
3) Actual gameplay demo  with some simple monsters, and reminaining 3 gladiators to choose from *



// -----------------------------------

Atheletics: (Considerations)
----------
1) The ability to immediately sprint from a crouching/combat position without having to change stance. (Acceleration pickup varies depending on skill).
2) Crouch + Sprint + Attack combo. (Pouncing attack)


Acrobatics: (Considerations)
----------
1) Variable Jump Power (Falling animation frame), 
2) Scale walls/Vault obstacles with jump and no jump. (Auto-jump when sprinting ahead)
3) Tumble when fall from great height (hold sprinting while in air?)


__________________________________________________
NEW ROADMAP:

For each island:

1) Towns/Villages: - Random Dungeon Layout over flattish areas ( processing async and save )
2) Resources & doodads: - Cave (marching squares in subtract), Noise over biome regions. Sparse noise doodads for stuff outside resource regions. (sync processing)
3) Rock outcrops along steep slopes: (especially at coast) (sync processing)
4) Dock jetty: - Bridge building minigame: (Saboteur style) or some random maze algorithm form start/end

(sync processing)
- Low/High resolution 512x512/1024x1024 splat/height (restricted to 3 textures and 1 slope texture)
- 512x512 blit maps that will stretch accordingly for larger environments.


Build dock scenerio
---------------------
Pathfinders have already went ahead and have called to build a dock location at a newfound island. Your boat party is requested to join in and supervise the construction of the dock.


Acid/oil water dock jetty disembark scenerio
---------------------------------------------
Either: 
1) Island area coasts are all cliffed up......, meaning only accessible from dock
2) Waters surrounding island is acidic, preventing boat from moving further in, having to disembark from outer.
3) A thick fog has descended on the island, preventing boat from safely travel further in.
4) Lots of rock outcrops around the coast, requiring diembarkabation at dock.
5) Or simply, oil spill fire, you can't just move in.

Boat party lands at dock,  while towns/villages will get generated in the background...After clearing the area of fog from within the loci of the dock, fog clears and entire terrain (is fully) revealed with towns also visible. Towns do not exist outside the vincity of the fog, but fog will be extremely thick. Enemies are in your way! Taking into account collision detection, move your blob party (or multiple parties) along the dangerous jetty and combat monsters accordingly.



Tech Roadmap: 
a) PRE-GENERATE: Plant resource areas/doodads on island
b) PRE/MAN-GENERATE: Jetty Dock location and structure on specific side of island 
c) POST-GENERATE: This can be done in prologue jetty crawling, or done progressively on-demand
	1) Identify flat areas to place village block layout
	2) Connect villages together
	3) Consider series of flat areas and whether to enclose them as walled city.

_______________________

Turn-based approach uses a system similar to Valkerie-Chronicles.

Turn based exploration (Whether there's enemies or not...) + Turn based combat: 
- Rigid party formations can move freely at the cost of 1 or 2 command points (but restricted to using the member with the lowest movement points, ie. slowest member in party). This can make it more economical than using 1 command point per individual, allowing your entire party to traverse greater distances.
-If navigating through difficult areas like forests and such where a rigid party formation is not possible, you'll have to do more micromanagement of individual members within party (as rigid blob formation no longer possible) and end up spending more command points per individual, affecting overall mobility of all your parties (or a party caught out in difficult terrain). This makes roads and open areas advantageous despite having disadvantages in terms of stealth/discreetness.
-Once all command points are used up, enemies (if any) may start moving (if enemies are expected, a short pause is used to simulate any possible enemy movement, otherwise, the game continues seamlessly), and enemies may make broad strategic decisions to actually flank your positions (if they've already spotted them).
  * advantage of this system is that you can have quite a lot of enemies visible on the map , but since they aren't moving all at once except for each turn, non-moving units can use precomputed static LOD geometry that reduces both draw calls and polycount, which is great for optimization. 
  * less CPU processing required, since it isn't entirely real-time (ie. not everyone is moving simulatneously), in particular, collision detection/steering between multiple agents/crowds, etc.
  * easier for enemy AI to respond to a static situation, compared to a dynamic one that requires more per-interval polling.
  * less bandwidth usage for multiplayer
  * more slower-paced, especially during exploration mode where micromanagement in/out of difficult terrain can be discouraging. However, when precise individual positions/paths are required for stealth, this is advantageous.

Real time exploration + Turn based combat:
- Up to 3 party members follow party leader through pathfinding when rigid blob  formation broken, but can explcitly try to move into formation facing a particular direction, when explictly called to do so.
- Other parties can follow Leader Party average position through pathfinding, and will do so, even in difficult araes, breaking rigid formation unless explicitly called to hold position from outside a difficult area, or to move into a certain specific position as directed by Leading Party. Optionally, can micromanage/individual control each party instead.
- Enemies patrol around in real-time, once spotted you and responds by attacking you with a weapon (or approaching at close-enough imminent melee engagement range), turn based combat mode is activated. Enemy has the turn initiative in this case, and may end up attacking you. Similar to Wizardry 8 system.
- Once you've spotted an enemy (whether the enemy has detected you or not), you can activate turn-based combat mode for both advancing and attacking. You have the turn initative in this case, and may be the one to deal attack first in some cases.  Similar to Wizardry 8 system.
- Turn-based combat mode can only be exited when you're out of engagement range, and the enemy (and all sides involved) have completed their turns.
   * more realistic
   * streamlines exploration, less micromanagement required until combat occurs. Creates a right balance between seamless exploration and detailed combat.
   * need to set up pathfinding nodes for difficult areas.
   * More AI coding required. May have problems with poorly coded AI and pathfinding (or just clustering/crowding issues), particularly if large groups are involved (ie. multiple parties). For a single party (of 4 men), this shouldn't be a problem though, but moving between parties may be difficult.

Real time combat: 
* More 'realistic'.
* The ability to abuse AI incompetancy with keeping up the pace of chasing/hitting, with the player kiting them constantly. This may happen if rudimentary AI processing is done at a pace that is lower than the framerate, thus player reactions/controls will always be faster than AI reactions. The only way to circumvent this is to create aggressive AI that responds to your movements per frame, so you can't easily kite them (at corners/obstacles especially), ensuring the player is locked in a melee struggle that is hard to escape from.
* Hard to manage/micormanage individuals within a short time, less emphasis on strategy or precise movements. This can be circumvented with a pause option used in many games like Dragon Age/Baldur's Gate.
* Easy to get over trivial enemy encounters that don't pose much danger, such as rats, insects, etc. Combat resolves quickly and seamlessly. This may be considered as an alternative to turn-based combat in certain situations, particularly for certain weak enemy types that can afford to be "stupid".
