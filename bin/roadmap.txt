 2) Include tumble-left/tumble-right  (find a way to also include... longjump ability...)

QPhysicsSystem to handle CollisionResultNode //and QJumpNode// , replace::::::::GroundCollisionSystem
3) Mock room cube geometry  +EllipsoidColliderSystem  and QPhysicsSYstem to handle MoveREsultNode (remove GroundPlaneSYstem)
4) Camera system (3rd person) with raycasting
5) Terrain geomery 

6) Camera system (1st person), trivial to implement but won't be used unless there's first-person models.
