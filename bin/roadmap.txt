------------------------
- Minigame (River map)
- Multiplayer integration.

______________________________________________

1) Include tumble-left/tumble-right, (jump velocity, ground normal WILL always not be available, or at least something to disable surface movmeent during duration of tumble) ! *
1a) (find a way to also include... longjump ability...) !

Animation fixes to:
- fix jump hangups *
- standing mode should use manual skin rotation and jog towards diection for strafe movement
- changing direction (strafe left - middle - strafe right ) should include animation blending  and gradual acceleration to either direction. (lower body dominant strafe vs upper body dominant strafe)
- changing stance could  take time and temporarily prevent any movement (velocity always set to zero!).  
  ->  default combat animation should be assigned to full-body  to support seamless transitioning of stance from combat to standing.
   -> full-body standing should be assigned to the 2 half-controllers. (instant pose) to lower stance to combat.
   //-> find a way to resolve combat->crouch stances and vice versa, 
 - possible to include falling jump animation

1b) Melee Attack.  Attach weapon to hand! * 
1c)  Spell: projectile/target/area-effect based attacks. First person view for projectile/target based attacks. Some projectiles are bouncing type, and some are sticky.... *
2) Paged terrain loading methods... * 
3) Actual gameplay demo  with some simple monsters, and reminaining 3 gladiators to choose from *



// -----------------------------------

Atheletics: (Considerations)
----------
1) The ability to immediately sprint from a crouching/combat position without having to change stance. (Acceleration pickup varies depending on skill).
2) Crouch + Sprint + Attack combo. (Pouncing attack)


Acrobatics: (Considerations)
----------
1) Variable Jump Power (Falling animation frame), 
2) Scale walls/Vault obstacles with jump and no jump. (Auto-jump when sprinting ahead)
3) Tumble when fall from great height (hold sprinting while in air?)
