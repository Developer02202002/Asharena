Pistol/Crossbow is used to shoot down enemies with penalties or actions. There is a range with these weapons.


Naive Miner AI:
-----------------
1) Start from top row, down to bottom, consider nearest-manhatten distance card match to goal and place card accordingly.

2) Sabotage suspected saboteurs

Choice is based on proximity to execute goal.


Naive Saboteur AI:
-------------------
-Weighing between suspicion and urgency weight ratio to consider whether to do sabotating acts * (chance of) being watched by miners:
1) Start from top row, down to bottom, consider nearest-manhatten distance card to goal, and block it, 
2) Find routes to nearest cards to goal, find only 1 path given blowing of somewhere in middle of route (thus no more path) and blow them up, in order of most connected surrounding nodes.

Choice is based on proximity to execute goal.

3) Sabotage miners (if 1 and 2 not available), but still keeping weighing of suspicion.

4) If Saboteur knows where gold is displaced to side, and can't do above actions, consider create route furthest away starting from top row to bottom.
