Encumbrance: How much weight you are carrying and how well your character copes with it.

Stamina/Fatique: The total amount of stamina you can sustain in combat before fatique sets in is a seperate factor altogether considering various aspects such as one's encumbrance, and cardiovascular fitness level. Generally, Speed/Athletics training helps deal with the latter factor, and Endurance/Weight-conditioning helps in the earlier factor. One's stamina pool can increase over time as he works towards such forms of training using either the latter or both.

Movement:

The speed you can jog comfortably isn't just dependant on your Speed attribute, but also on other factors like your Encumbrance and Fatique tolerance. Sprinting will basically force your character to move at his fastest possible speed, at the expense of depleting stamina.


Magic:

Unlike the distant past of Elder legends where magic was often mentioned to be known within distinct schools of destruction, conjuration, restoration, mysticism, illusion and alteration, magic in present-day Dominul simply involved 4 key elements of fire, sand, blood and spirit, brought about through the Imperial Realm's mixture of philosophy, religion, geography and pseudo-science. The Imperials often used what they knew to create "powerful" weapons that could destroy and invoke damage, shock, fear, and confusion in the battlefield. These skills and knowledge were later learnt/stolen by the various inhabitants of Dominul and soon became a commonplace all around the continent for both offensive/defensive use within combat and non-combat situations.


The Imperials:

Imperial (non-playable, NPC "race") - Fighting Imperial man are often trained in fields such as Bow, CrossBow, Spear, Long blade and Medium/Heavy armour and Shield. Due to their geographically central location, they are good in all manners of social interaction and commerce such as and Etiquette and Mercantile, welcoming many immigrants to their realm. Any  "Imperial" that was mixed with any of the 4 given races, and can be titled "Imperial-Slavus", "Imperial-Dimachao", "Imperial-Flammus" or "Imperial-Samnian" in some cases to signify an imperial mixed breed. Despite the sandy environment in the middle of the continent and relative dryness within the Imperial Realm, the innovative locals have found ways to prosper their central province into a a vibrant city center.
